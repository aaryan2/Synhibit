# Synhibit - Using ML to Prevent Cancers



<br>
<h2>Overview</h2>


This project was the result of a roughly month-long research project that aimed at taking a new approach to cancer therapy.
As someone who's been researching cancer diagnostics for the past couple of years, it's been quite alarming to notice
that, for such a widespread disease that medicine hasn't been able to consistently cure, that cancer wasn't being treated
the same way that most other diseases were dealt with. Despite **trillions of dollars** going into funding for the disease, it was
a pretty big shock to see that all of that money went into developing cures, whereas almost no time, effort, or capital was being
directed into finding a **preventative** measure similar other diseases such the cold.

By its nature, cancer is a genetic condition, and encompasses a vast number of forms that affect specific regions of the body
(eg. brain, lung, bone cancers). Cancers disrupt the healthy growth systems put in place by the host's healthy cells, and initiates
a uncontrolled cell growth that can form solid tumours, metastasize (spread), destroy organs, and ultimately lead to death unless
cured. Or even better - **prevented**. Long before someone even develops cancer, their cells have to undergo a set of mutations in 
specific regions of their DNA that oversee their growth, survival, and rate of reproduction. 

Normally, our cells can detect these abrupt changes to their genetic "instruction manual", and initiate a protocol called 
**apoptosis**,  which essentially allows them to self-destruct for the safety of their host. Cancer; however, did find a workaround 
to this process through driver mutations, which are much too large for cells to attempt to fix, and often, they even inhibit the part
of the cell's DNA that initiates apoptosis:<br><br><br>

A healthy person would have to accumulate between 2-9 of these mutations to actually develop cancer (depending on the type of cancer,
as well as the genetic mutations aquired), but it's important to keep in mind that many people can inherit these mutations as a hereditary
genetic malfunction, and that could make for much fewer accumulated mutations necessary for cancer to take place. Mutations take place
through the external factors we're exposed to, and every factor causes a cascade of cellular and chemical reaction in us. These
'cascades' are known as **cellular pathways**, and when we're exposed to negative factors (eg. smoking, alcohol, poor diet).
These negative pathways get expressed, and bring about negative results and can lead to the driver mutations that cause cancers. 
Of course, while there are other ways mutations can occur, but cellular pathways form the basis of the cycle.

But, what if we could **proactively** inhibit these mutations that can cause cancer when expressed?

With investments in the field cancer prevention only recently beginning to ramp-up, the opportunity opened up to harness the power
of machine learning (ML) for this approach - a field that focuses on the use of **statistical models** developed by computers to fit 
data that humans can't even comprehend. If we succesfully trained this model on the main compounds that inhibit the expression
of cancer-causing pathways, then that could literally change the way we see cancer treatment. Using the compounds screened, or even
generated by the model, we could discover much more specific, safe, and affordable compounds to repress mutations that cause our cells
to go off course, and even potentially develop a **preventitive vaccine for cancer!** <br><br><br>

<h2>Gathering Data</h2>

To successfully develop this model, I needed a dataset, but of course, there were absolutely none around. The next best option was
to create my own, so that's what I did. Initially, the process was meant to automatically gather data using the Pubchem API, but
that wouldn't seem to work (future step though). So, I went with the next best option of manually picking the datapoints from
an extensive cancer pathway inhibiting dataset from this website => https://www.bocsci.com/tag/cancer-381.html, as well
as Wikipedia for a list of **carcinogens**, as they were basically the only things that would be **guaranteed** to not have therapeutic 
effects towards cancer, since you can never really be sure about that with other random compounds. It was especially sueful to make 
use of that site, since it contained specific compounds that could selectively target specific cellular pathways, and as you'll see 
later, that came real-handy as extra features when training the model:

<br><br>


So, after hours of scouring compounds and Ctrl+C'ing data into a spreadsheet, the dataset aspect was done. Now, the fun could
begin - training the model! Firstly ,I've got to mention that, while I do have some experience in developing ML models, I realized
that it would take a lot of unnecessary time and effort to do so for this scenario. With this in mind, I decided to go with one
of my favourite platforms to develop classification ML algorithms - without code - **MATLAB!** Usually, for similar platforms that
function without code, you face limitations to customizability, but with MATLAB, you don't really have to face the same barriers
since you can customize in most ways you could with the use of code. 

<br><br>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

By importing the dataset I created into the MATLAB workspace and using the classification learning app, I created an Optimizable 
**Naive Bayes** model, and it was the best for two major reasons: I tried out all the available models on the site and it performed the
best, as well as the fact that the Naive Bayes algorithm tends to perform well for more noisy and widely distrubuted (scattered) 
datasets such as this one.

Finally, for what you might have been waiting for since the start - the RESULTS! Well, see for yourself:

The model ended up getting in insanely high **92.3% accuracy!** That literally means that we now have a way of consistently
discovering new compounds that could better inhibit cancers, rather than treat them when they happen. Of course, this is incredibly
promising, but for this to really be considered a success, we need to obtain similar results with a much, much larger dataset,
and don't be worries, because I'm getting my weapons ('Python 2.7 and the PubChem API') ready, to do what's possibly going to be 
the largest chemical web-scraping project the world has ever seen! Hopefully, Synhibit can move on to help in the discovery of these 
compounds, especially when there's trillions to choose from, and who knows? Maybe the project could lead to the contents of your
future cancer vaccine? Till then, stay updated, because they'll keep coming. I hope you enjoyed!
